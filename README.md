# Daily Coding Problem 2019-08-29

####  _Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today._

This problem was asked by Google.

Given pre-order and in-order traversals of a binary tree, write a function to reconstruct the tree.

For example, given the following preorder traversal:

    [a, b, d, e, c, f, g]

And the following inorder traversal:

    [d, b, e, a, f, c, g]

You should return the following tree:

         a
        / \
       b   c
      / \ / \
     d  e f  g
